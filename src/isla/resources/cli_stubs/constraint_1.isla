# This constraint specifies that all variables (in the assignment language declared
# by the grammar files) occurring on the right-hand side of an assignment have to
# appear in the left-hand side of an *earlier* assignment, as in `x := 1 ; y := x`.
# You can pass multiple constraint files to the ISLa solver CLI. In this case, the
# constraints are combined as a *conjunction*.
