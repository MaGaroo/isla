# This constraint adds to the basic correctness constraint in file
# {constraint_2_file.name}, which imposes a definition-use requirement, the requirement
# that at least one variable in the generated assignment program must be an `a`. The
# ISLa solver CLI creates a *conjunction* from this constraint and the other one.
