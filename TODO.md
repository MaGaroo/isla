ISLa TODOs
==========

* FIX: count predicate, CSV example: Check why we don't get multiline CSV files, and why formulas appear multiple times
* Add aggregations, e.g. sum, count.
  *How to generate with aggregations? Resolve at end? Do we need them, or can they be replaced by semantic predicates*
* Add further structural predicates, e.g., "inside / below"
* Evaluate different heuristics for next state selection (or some randomization? Then, one could, e.g., earlier on
  explore longer derivations...)
* Evaluate how good it works to first generate a lot of trees and only then apply quantifiers etc. Is it quicker /
  leading to more diverse inputs?
