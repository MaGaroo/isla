# TODOs and Open Issues

- Translation of "free nonterminals" together with unnamed bound variables:
  Support formulas like `(...<A>...) and (exists <A>: ...<A>...)` or check
  whether this is already supported. But at least in one combination of the
  elements of the propositional combination, it probably fails (a free variable
  remains).
